# Tool organizer options.


## TLDR

Use flexi-storage double-slot system as base attached to walls. This can mount
shelves, baskets, pegbords, toteholders etc.

Use flexi-storage double-rail pegboards for pegboards. For larger pegboards
consider using Pinnacle metal pegboard either attached direcly to the wall, or
mounted onto double-slots.

Use DIN Rails attached to double-slot rails for tools and totes. These can
also be attached to the edge of shelves, or directly to walls. Can also be
angle-mounted for convenient tool access. The better metal alternative to
french cleats.

Use Sy's Peglock system for pegboard hooks, etc. This uses a single peg
attachment that can be used with a huge variet of holders/hooks/etc.

Use a modified Sy's Peglock attachment for DIN rails. This allows you to
attach any Sy's Peglock compatible things to DIN rails

Use Gridfinity for drawer/desktop organizers? Can be used with Sy's Peglock
attachments to mount on pegboards or DIN rails too.

What about budget parts bins, wall mounted or mounted on DIN rails?

Use totes for parts storage? Mouted on DIN rails or flexi-storage tote boards?


what about wallcontrol pegboards? pegs+slotsin one board, can mount shelves?


## pegboard

There are a few different variants around;

1" 25.4mm pitch square, 9/32" 7.14mm holes (1/4" 6.35mm nominal), 1/4" 6.35mm thick MDF/Fiberboard
1/2" 12.7mm pitch square, 3/16" 4.76mm holes (1/8" 3.175mm nominal), 1/8" 3.175mm thick MDF/Fiberboard
25mm pitch square, 6.?mm holes (6mm nominal), 1.5mm thick metal
25mm pitch square, 5.75mm holes (5mm nominal), 0.5mm thick metal

Hooks designed for steel pegboards typically assume 0.8mm - 2mm thick.

Many steel pegboards seem to have nominal 5mm holes with actually metric 25mm spacing
rather than the proper 25.4mm inch.

25.4mm spacing, 6mm peg, 6.35mm thick std 1" MDF
12.7mm spacing, 3mm peg, 3.17mm thick std 1/2" MDF
25mm spacing, 6mm peg, 1.5mm thick thick metal
25mm spacing, 5mm peg, 1.0mm thick std metal
25mm spacing, 5mm peg, 0.5mm thick thin metal

## tote systems

hanging storage container system. Note will hang on DIN Rails.

## frenchcleat
popular with woodworkers since all made of wood.

## DIN Rail
This is a nice metal alternative to french-cleat. See
https://github.com/RussNelson/tool-holders

## slatwall
Often used in eg shoe-shops

## single/double wall strip shelving

modular wall mount shelving systems. There seems to be 40mm pitch as the most
common, and less common 32mm pitch. However, the stuff from bunnings is 32mm
pitch.


## Sy's Peglock System

3D printable pegboard system. Has a board attachment peg that different mounts
slip onto. Nice design, parametric onshape for different pegboards. Some
mounts use 10x3mm disc magnets.

## Gridfinity system

An open standard container format with multiples of 42x42x7mm sizes in a base
plate. Designed for organizing inside drawers, but also has mounts for things
like Sy's peglog system. Base and containers can use 6x2mm disc magnets for better
connections.

## Magnets.

These can be used for attachments in things like Sy's peglock and gridfinity.
Gridfinity uses 6x2mm, and Sy's peglock uses 10x3mm, but could use 8x3mm,
7x3mm, or even 6x3mm? It's not clear how much strength is needed.

There are many different shapes/sizes but it seems disc magnets are the most
popular and best value. The Nxx ratings are for the magnet material with high
numbers being stronger magnets. For magnets with 1kg+ of pull force, the
cheapest (for 10+) are;

6x2mm  N38 0.54kg $0.60
6x3mm  N38 0.80kg $0.86
6x4mm  N42 1.10kg $0.89
7x3mm  N38 1.04kg $0.86
7x3mm  N50 1.35kg $1.12
8x3mm  N50 1.67kg $1.32
8x5mm  N38 1.87kg $1.38
10x3mm N42 1.96kg $1.73
10x2mm N38 1.00kg $2.28
10x2mm N52 1.48kg $2.70
10x5mm N38 2.50kg $2.75
20x3mm N42 4.30kg $4.54

See https://magnet.com.au/ for all your magnet needs with an awesome website
for finding what you need. Bunnings also sells 8x3mm magnets, and Jaycar sells
10x3mm magnets;

The double slot system is stronger and has a wider range of options, and is
strangely cheaper.

Tracks must be 558mm (inside-to-inside) apart, or 583mm on-center apart, for
the fixed-width accessories to fit. But note the shelves are all multiples of
300mm long, so putting them end-to-end eventualy "overflows" the railings.
